# Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

A full-stack HRMS application built to manage Employees, Teams, and their assignments. This project features a robust backend with audit logging, a responsive frontend dashboard, and follows a layered architecture pattern.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

*   **Employee Management**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee records.
*   **Team Management**: Ability to create and list teams within an organization.
*   **Team Assignment**: Many-to-Many relationship handling allows assigning employees to multiple teams.
*   **Organization Support**: Multi-tenancy support where users register under an organization.

### 🛡️ Backend & Security

*   **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all critical actions (Create, Update, Assign) stored in the database for audit trails.
*   **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with bcryptjs for password hashing.
*   **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns using Controllers, Routes, and Middleware.

### 💻 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database**: SQLite (via Prisma ORM)
*   **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd hrms-assignment
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the server folder and install dependencies.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Environment Variables:**
The project uses SQLite, so no external DB setup is required for development. The `.env` file is automatically generated by Prisma, but ensure it contains:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
PORT=5000
```

**Run Migrations & Start Server:**

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm start
```

The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate to the client folder, and install dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Start React App:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173`
